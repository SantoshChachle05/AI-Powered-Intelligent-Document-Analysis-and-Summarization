# AI-Powered-Intelligent-Document-Analysis-and-Summarization
Combines computer vision (for OCR, layout analysis, table detection,image enhancements,page matching Algorithm) with GenAI (for Extracting Values from complex documents). 

Overview
Welcome to the repository for AI-Powered Intelligent Document Analysis and Summarization. This project leverages a powerful combination of computer vision and Generative AI to intelligently process, analyze, and summarize complex documents. The goal is to transform unstructured data into actionable insights and concise summaries, automating a traditionally manual and time-consuming process.

‚ú® Features
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Accurately extracts text from a wide range of document types, including scanned images and PDFs.

Layout Analysis: Identifies and understands the structure of documents, differentiating between headings, paragraphs, tables, and images.

Table Detection and Extraction: Precisely locates and extracts tabular data, converting it into a structured format like CSV or JSON.

Image Enhancements: Applies advanced image processing techniques to improve the quality of scanned documents, ensuring higher OCR accuracy.

Page Matching Algorithm: Intelligently links pages that belong to the same logical document, even if they are from different sources or scans.

GenAI-powered Value Extraction: Utilizes large language models to accurately identify and extract specific key-value pairs and other critical information from unstructured text.

Automated Summarization: Generates concise, context-aware summaries of entire documents, highlighting the most important information.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Computer Vision: OpenCV, Tesseract, and custom-trained models for layout and table detection.

Generative AI: OpenAI's GPT models or other relevant large language models (LLMs) for summarization and data extraction.

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks: PyTorch / TensorFlow (for custom models)

üìö How It Works
The system follows a multi-stage pipeline:

Preprocessing: Documents are cleaned and enhanced to optimize for OCR.

Computer Vision: The enhanced document is passed through the computer vision pipeline for OCR, layout analysis, and table detection. This stage creates a structured representation of the document's contents.

GenAI Analysis: The text and structured data are fed to a Generative AI model, which is prompted to perform tasks like value extraction and summarization.

Output Generation: The final output is generated in a user-friendly format, such as JSON for extracted data and plain text for summaries.
